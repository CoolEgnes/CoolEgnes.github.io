<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<p><strong>December 2022-August 2024</strong> Data Analyst at Wuhan Mingde Biological Co.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Spearheaded the development and implementation of the first Machine Learning algorithm in the product.Built up an equation for calculating the concentration of Hct in the blood samples. Advanced the accuracy of the results from 56% to 84%.
  </li>
  <li>
    Designed and implemented algorithms for calculating and calibrating electrode measurements, contributed to an overall 15% improvement in the accuracies of electrodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Contributed to data processing and analysis tasks and the development of MATLAB tools, contributed to more efficient data analysis.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>June 2022-October 2022</strong> Algorithm Engineer at Wuhan Hengyang Jushu Co.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Led research on Named Entity Extraction, both closed and open domains. Achieved an accuracy of over 92% using a supervised algorithm, and an accuracy of 80% using an unsupervised algorithm, by implementing the set of rules designed by myself.
  </li>
  <li>
    Conducted projects independently on Text Classification based on Bert with an accuracy of 96%. The project was deployed online for practical application.
  </li>
  <li>
    Took part in the development of a multimodal intelligent search engine, and contributed to the evaluation and improvement of the system's performance.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p><strong>August 2024</strong> Algorithm of calculating the concentration of Hct in blood samples</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Based on the results of experiments, identifying key factors affecting the concentration of Hct (c(Hct)) in blood samples. Including concentration of Na+, signal values in the electrode and so on.
  </li>
  <li>
    Analyzed the relationship between different factors and c(Hct), quantifying the functional relationship between various factors and c(Hct).
  </li>
  <li>
    Utilized MATLAB to filter the most important variables, explored the formula to calculate the c(Hct), and achieved a 1x accuracy of 84%, and a 2x accuracy of over 90%. Achieved a performance improvement of approximately 15%.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>September 2022</strong> Open Domain Named Entity Extraction</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Developed a rule-based unsupervised name entity extraction algorithm, addressing the limitations of supervised methods and reducing the cost of data preparation.
  </li>
  <li>
    The rules were designed based on the syntactic structure of Chinese statements, thus it's universally applicable.
  </li>
  <li>
    The algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 80% on simple sentences, which normally contains around 15-30 words.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>February 2022-June 2022</strong> Deep Learning Based Pedestrian Counting</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Developed algorithms to count pedestrians in public places to aid public security reviews. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Optimized MCNN, Faster R-CNN and YOLOV3 models considering varied pedestrian contributions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Achieved MAE 25.21 and MSE 43.68 with MCNN; Faster R-CNN and YOLOV3 reached a precision of 0.868 and 0.861 respectively.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>June 21</strong>Weibo Post Sentiment Classification</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Scraped ~100,000 real-time posts from Weibo, a social media like Facebook, and processed and cleaned data using jieba and ltp.
  </li>
  <li>
    Implemented sentiment classification using the XGBoost model, achieving an accuracy of 80%.
