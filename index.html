<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<p><strong>December 2022-August 2024</strong> Data Analyst at Wuhan Mingde Biological Co.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Designed and implemented algorithms for calculating and calibrating electrode measurements, contributing to an approximate 10% improvement in accuracy for all 10 electrodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Contributed to data processing tasks and the development of MATLAB tools, reduced time to analyze data by about 20 percent. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Spearheaded the creation of the product line's first machine learning algorithm, develop the equation for targeted variables using machine learning functions, improved the accuracy of the electrode from 56% to 85%.
